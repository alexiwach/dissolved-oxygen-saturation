# dissolved-oxygen-saturation
This script calculates the dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation in percent based on the temperature, atmospheric pressure and the DO concentration in mg/l.  The approach used is based on Weiss's method as described in the paper "https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/memos/documents/WQ.2011.03.pdf"
